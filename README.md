🎯 Project Overview
This project tackles the challenge of predicting loan approval decisions using a dataset of ~5,000 loan applications. The main focus is on handling imbalanced data where loan rejections significantly outnumber approvals, making it a perfect case study for advanced classification techniques.
Problem Statement

Objective: Build a reliable model to predict loan approval/rejection
Challenge: Handle class imbalance in loan approval data
Goal: Maximize F1-score while maintaining good precision and recall

📊 Dataset Description
The dataset contains the following features for each loan application:

Dataset Statistics

Total Samples: ~5,000 loan applications
Features: 12 input features + 1 target variable
Class Distribution: Imbalanced (more rejections than approvals)
Missing Values: Handled through imputation strategies

💡 Key Insights
Business Insights

CIBIL Score Threshold: Applicants with scores >650 have significantly higher approval rates
Debt-to-Income Ratio: Keep ratio <0.4 for better approval chances
Asset Backing: Higher asset values strongly correlate with approvals
Education Impact: Graduate degree provides moderate advantage
Employment Type: Self-employed applicants face slightly higher rejection rates

Technical Insights

Class Imbalance Impact: SMOTE improved recall by 15-25% across models
Feature Engineering Value: New features improved model performance by 8-12%
Model Selection: Tree-based models outperformed linear models
Hyperparameter Tuning: GridSearch provided 3-5% performance boost

Risk Factors for Rejection

Low CIBIL score (<550)
High debt-to-income ratio (>0.6)
Low asset backing
High number of dependents with low income
Very high loan amounts relative to income
